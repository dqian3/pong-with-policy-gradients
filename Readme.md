# Pong with Policy Gradients ðŸ”¨ðŸ‘· 

A workshop to train a simple reinforcement learning agent to play pong using vanilla policy gradients.

Adapted from [http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/) and rewritten with PyTorch.

What you'll need:

- Python >=3.6
- Pytorch
- Tensorflow >=2.0
- OpenAI Gym w/ Atari (`$ pip install "gym[atari]"`)



To run it yourself:

```bash
$ python pong.py [--render]
```

where `--render` is an optional flag that renders pong games and slows them down to a watchable speed.



To view [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) visualizations during training, open a separate terminal and run:

```bash
$ tensorboard --logdir tensorboard_logs
```

and visit [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006/).



There are five `### TODO:` statements where you'll need to fill in short pieces of code (no longer than a few lines) defining the policy network and calculating the policy gradients.

Solution and trained network in `solution (spoiler alert!)` folder - try to do it yourself first!
